(pre) what is shell (a capture from bird's linux), what's the default shell come with ubuntu, what are the common shells most widely used today.

## Switch from bash(default shell) to zsh
 if cannot change the default shell by command line
 ```
 chsh -s $(which zsh)
 ```
 And it return 'user does not exist in /etc/passwd', you could use 'X-terminal-emulator', and configure a shell in 'Terminator Preferences' --> 'Profiles'-->'Command'--> Check 'Run a custom command instead of my shell'-->'Custom comand:/usr/bin/zsh' 

## Install zsh 

## Install and configure oh-my-zsh

## Install exa as replacement of ls
### Install download binary (where to put binary file, manual file, and config auto completion)
